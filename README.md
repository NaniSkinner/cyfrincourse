# Cyfrin Solidity Course Journey

## Overview
This repository contains my personal notes and smart contract challenge solutions as I progress through the [Cyfrin Solidity Course](https://www.cyfrin.io/) by Patrick Collins. Here, I document my learning journey in blockchain development and Solidity programming.

## Repository Structure

### üìù Notes
- `VideoNotes.md/` - Contains detailed notes from course lectures
  - Currently includes notes on SimpleStorage contract and basic Solidity concepts

### üî® Smart Contract Challenges
As I progress through the course, this section will be populated with various smart contract implementations and challenges.

## Topics Covered (In Progress)

### Foundational Concepts
- Basic Solidity Types
- Smart Contract Structure
- Variable Declaration and Management
- Data Types (uint, int, bool, string, address, bytes)

### Smart Contracts
1. SimpleStorage Contract
   - Basic variable storage
   - Data type implementation
   - Contract structure

## Learning Goals
